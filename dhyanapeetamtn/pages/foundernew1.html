On the tenth day after his   birth, an astrologer was summoned to cast his horoscope and awed by the unique   configuration of planets in Nithyananda&rsquo;s birthchart exclaimed that Nithyananda   would grow up to be a <em>Raja Sannyasi</em> (King among   Swamis).</div></td>

                        <p align="justify">True to the astrologer's words, Rajasekaran   showed spiritual inclinations from a tender age. He would make idols out of mud,   clay and soap stone, decorate them and worship them with a deep fervor. This   aspect of Nithyananda&rsquo;s personality would remain unchanged; the miniature stone   figures have been superceded by the spectacular and towering deity idols that   grace the temples of Life Bliss Foundation in North America and other countries   today.</p>
                    <p align="justify">In childhood as well as throughout his   wandering years, Nithyananda was deeply inspired by two great saints of Bharat,   Sri Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi. A photograph of Ramakrishna was the focus   of Nithyananda&rsquo;s worship practices, and he was blessed to have had direct   darshan, or superconscious experience of Ramakrishna in the flesh. His spiritual   teachers in Thiruvannamalai awakened Nithyananda&rsquo;s enormous latent spiritual   potential. </p></td>

                              <img height="223" hspace="5" src="../images/web.archive.org/web/20100613105918im_/http%EF%B9%95/dhyanapeetamtn.org/images/RagupathiYogi.jpg" width="142" align="left"/>Raghupati Yogi   instructed young Nithyananda in Yoga methods and processes that would strengthen   His body and mind, in preparation for the Herculean tasks of today. Raghupati   Yogi would emphasize to Nithyananda that the optimal period, during which one   can truly imbibe the truths of Yoga so that they become a solid experience, is   before the age of 14; accordingly, he trained Nithyananda starting from age 3   for a period of 10 full years. Raghupati Yogi taught Nithyananda <em>asanas</em>, <em>pranayama</em>, <em>dhyana</em>, and also other esoteric   Yogic methods, including how to resist hunger and thirst, which would prove to   be invaluable during the intense<em> parivrajaka </em>years, or years of   wandering as a renunciant. Above all, Raghupati Yogi truly helped prepare   Nithyananda&rsquo;s body to receive, hold, and express the high energy of   enlightenment.</p>
                          <p><u><em>Mataji   Kuppammal</em></u><br/>
                            Another key teacher was Mataji Kuppammal, who was a   spiritual adept who had mastered the mystical science of <em>Kundalini tantra </em>by the age of 12. She became a great inspiration and a compassionate guide   to young Nithyananda. When Nithyananda was around seven and was at the altar of   Goddess Parvati inside the Arunachaleshwara temple one day, he suddenly had a   vision of a golden colored geometric figure, which he then immediately carved   from memory onto a copper sheet with a nail. Kuppammal explained to him that   what he had drawn was the very powerful <em>Sri Chakra</em>, a complex and   metaphorical representation of the universal energy. Kuppammal then initiated   Nithyananda into the science of <em>tantra</em>, which uses the <em>Sri Chakra </em>as a base for meditation practices.</p>
                          <p>Kuppammal led Nithyananda from <em>bhakti </em>(devotion)   into <em>jnana </em>(wisdom) and <em>dhyana </em>(meditation), with the help of   her own Master, Isakki Swamigal, who also contributed to Nithyananda&rsquo;s growing   realization. Kuppammal gave Nithyananda many books and predicted that he would   keep these books till he himself started providing commentaries on them based on   his wisdom.</p>

                          <p><u><em>Arunagiri   Yogishwar</em></u><br/>
                            The very first awareness of His own   inner nature, His very first brush with His incarnated being, and the first   revelation of His life&rsquo;s mission, happened to Nithyananda when he met with   Arunagiri Yogiswara, who is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Siva   Himself, at age nine. Nithyananda took to sitting in front of the <em>jiva   samadhi </em>of Arunagiri Yogiswara, at the Arunachaleshwara temple, and that is   where their meeting first happened.</p>
                          <p>Arunagiri Yogiswara was the first being who helped   Nithyananda develop a conscious experience of Himself. On one occasion,   Arunagiri Yogishwar mystically transported Nithyananda to a sacred Banyan tree   under which He taught His disciples as a young Dakshinamurthi, and gave   Nithyananda a saffron robe, which is now at the ashram in Bangalore - living   proof that what happened then was not a dream!</p>
                          <p>In their final encounter, Arunagiri Yogiswara said to   Nithyananda, &lsquo;Dear one, you and I are one. We can never get separated. But the   play is over. You will not miss me any longer. You will not be separated. We are   one.&rsquo; Saying this, the form of Arunagiri Yogiswara merged into Nithyananda and   disappeared from his view. From that moment, Nithyananda did not feel the   separation from Arunagiri Yogiswara at all. A deep fulfillment descended on him;   a state of bliss. Nithyananda says<strong>, </strong>&lsquo;it was probably my first   moment of realization of who I really was. It was my first spiritual experience,   my first moment of enlightenment.&rsquo;</p>
                          <p>It was only later that Nithyananda realized that the person he played with,   he related so closely with, this Arunagiri Yogiswara was none other than   Arunachala, Siva Himself.</p>
                          <p><u><em>Annamalai Swamigal</em></u><br/>
                              <img height="203" hspace="5" src="../images/web.archive.org/web/20100613105823im_/http%EF%B9%95/dhyanapeetamtn.org/images/Annamalai_Swamigal.jpg" width="140" align="left"/>Around the age   of 10, Nithyananda started going to the Ramana Ashram in Tiruvannamalai, where   one day He met Annamalai Swamigal, an enlightened disciple of Ramana Maharishi.   Annamalai Swamigal was a master of the <em>advaita </em>philosophy of   non-duality. A lasting impression was created in the mind of Young Nithyananda   through Annamalai Swamigal&rsquo;s teachings, which remained a source of strength and   inspiration in years to come. Hs experience with Annamalai Swamigal helped   Nithyananda to go beyond the illusion of thoughts directly into the source of   thoughts.</p>
                          Nithyananda practiced the technique   that Annamalai Swamigal had taught him faithfully, and around age twelve, when   he was sitting on a rock on Arunachala hill in meditation, the first experience   of Cosmic Consciousness, or satori, happened. In the midst of his meditation,   Nithyananda felt something opening up within him. It was like a vessel inside   getting broken and a door opening simultaneously, an experience of creation and   destruction at the same time. It was an experience of utter bliss, serene   calmness and connectedness with the Universe.&nbsp; Even with his eyes closed,   Nithyananda could see in a panoramic vision encompassing all 360 degrees around   him.</div>

                        <span class="style1">Later Years </span>
                        <p align="justify">Nithyananda would often meditate all night   long in the cremation grounds of Tiruvannamalai, absorbed in the vibrant silence   of Arunachala, and at the break of dawn, he would return home. During his   teenage years, after a profound cognitive shift in his understanding through an   encounter with a Siddha in Thiruvannamalai, the urge which he had since   childhood, to leave home as a sannyasi, reached its peak. After completing his   diploma in Mechanical Engineering at Gudiyattam, Nithyananda made the final   resolve to set out on his spiritual journey as a wandering ascetic. He embarked   on what was to be an arduous journey, stretching thousands of miles covered   mostly by foot, over a period of 6 years, traversing the land of Bharat. From   Tapovan in the Himalayas to Kanyakumari in the South, from Dwaraka in the West   to Ganga Sagar in the East, Nithyananda wandered for several years in India and   in Nepal, practicing intense austerities and studying with many sadhus. </p>
                      <p align="justify">Amongst Nithyananda&rsquo;s numerous soul-stirring   experiences was this one, in the Himalayas:<br/>
                        One day in Gaurikund, high in the   Himalayas, he saw a lovely vision, of a young man with a glowing countenance and   flowing locks, walking towards him with long strides and captivating grace. He   realized, only after physically verifying the solidity of the radiant and divine   being facing him, it was <strong>Mahaavatar Babaji</strong>, the Enlightened   Master who has dwelled in the Himalayas for thousands of years in perpetual   youth. At the moment of passing by him, Babaji looked into his eyes and   pronounced, '<em>Paramahamsa Sri Nithyananda</em>!&rsquo; &ndash; signifying the state he   would soon come to achieve.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Nithyananda's single-minded pursuit of the   Divine truth led to deeper and more profound experiences over the years.   Finally, when He was 22 years old and staying on the banks of the river Narmada,   the final explosion happened, into the experience of <strong>Superconsciousness, </strong><strong>where </strong>space and time, body and mind, the seer and the   seen - all dissolved into<strong> the state of Eternal Bliss, </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> Nithya Ananda. </strong></p>
                      <p align="justify" class="style2">After Enlightenment</p>
                      <p align="justify">After the explosion of superconsciousness,   Nithyananda stayed in Erode, on the banks of the river Kaveri in Tamil Nadu for   a few months, healing people and teaching meditation. Guided by Divine Vision,   Nithyananda soon left Erode and came to the outskirts of Bangalore, where He   found the place of His ashram, home to a 600-year old sacred and mystical banyan   tree as revealed in His Vision. </p>
                      <p class="style1">The Mission</p>
                      <p align="justify">In the Master&rsquo;s own words, &quot;Enlightenment   flowers when individual consciousness disappears into Universal Consciousness.   It is the no-mind experience, and out of it Ecstasy and Energy are born. This   Energy is what I harness, to help humanity to blossom in all dimensions of life,   and to attain and radiate Eternal Bliss - Nithyananda&quot;. </p>
                      <p align="justify">Bliss is a state of heightened awareness of   the reasons for our fear, joy, sorrow or love. It is a state of being in tune   with the Cosmos, the ideal state to be. 'Be Blissful!' are the words the Master   utters to constantly remind us of our true nature. With a pragmatic yet   compassionate approach to life, and an enlightened insight into the core of   human nature, through lucid explanation of practical issues and practical   meditation techniques, He helps individuals to blossom in every sphere of life,   be it physical, mental, emotional or spiritual.<br/>
                            <br/>
                        Nithyananda's healing   touch has given relief to millions of people suffering from a spectrum of   illnesses, both physical and psychological. His method of healing &ndash; <strong>Nithya Spiritual </strong><strong>Healing</strong>, has its roots in   meditation and harnesses the Divine Energy to allow it to flow to the recipient   of the healing. Nithyananda not only heals, but also initiates those who desire   to be an instrument of the Divine energy, to become healers. Today, thousands of   Nithya Spiritual Healers and healing centers carry out this service to humanity   at large and touch tens of thousands of people each day. </p>
                      <p align="justify">Nithyananda has developed a diverse range of   meditation programs devised for the modern minds of our generation. The   remarkable techniques and processes that comprise the meditation programs help   the flowering and explosion of individual consciousness, and are offered by   ordained teachers, or acharyas, trained personally by Him. Advanced level   programs are conducted by Nithyananda Himself, and are a rare and unprecedented   opportunity to be in the presence of the Master, and to experience the deep   stillness, silence and ecstasy of our inner being.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam </strong>is a   movement for meditation and establishing a Vedic renaissance on our planet. With   over 1200 centers in 33 countries, the foundation works towards the   transformation of humanity through transformation of the individual. In keeping   with His breathtaking vision of a complete Vedic renaissance, Nithyananda is   simultaneously spearheading movements for the re-establishment of all aspects of   Vedic sciences, arts, culture and lifestyle, through the founding of a   Meditation and Yoga University, temples of traditional Sanatana Dharma worship   practices, and ashrams and spiritual communities worldwide to create an   environment where one can experience and express Bliss on all levels of life.
