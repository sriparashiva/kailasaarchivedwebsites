			<h2 class="title"><b>Free Discourses</b> on Patanjali's Yoga Sutras<br>Yoga Secrets Revealed!</h2>
			<h3 class="meta">March 10, 11 &amp; 12 (Tues, Wed &amp; Thurs)  7pm-10pm</h3>
			<div class="story">
				<p><small>Speaking on the Yoga Sutras, the original text on Yoga as expounded by the great Sage Patanjali, <i>Paramahamsa Nithyananda</i> will share the authentic science of Yoga - not as just a posture or practice, but as a tool for living blissfully - Living Enlightenment.</small><br>
				   <br>
				   <b>March 10 (Tuesday) 7pm-10pm</b><br>
				   <b>Topic:</b> Zoom in Your Concentration - Expand Your Capacity!<br>
				   <small>The mind is not the entire brain or the only work of the brain as we think.  It is just another functionality in us.  If used only when required, then it is under our control.  If used as a 24-hour industry, then we are under its control.  Yoga is a technique and a way of life to handle the mind and cause it to function the way it should.  Yoga makes the mind a powerful tool in our hands.</small><br>
				   <small><i>Paramahamsa Nithyananda</i> talks on Sage Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, explaining how the mind can be purified and kept as a beautiful space where activity can happen when essential and dissolve into silence at all other times.</small><br>
				   <br>
				   <b>March 11 (Wednesday) 7pm-10pm</b><br>
				   <b>Topic:</b> The Science of Understanding - Liberate from Delusion!<br>
				   <small>What the world calls our nature, is nothing but the mental patterns that we hold in our mind, based on our past.  These patterns prevent us from having a fresh perception on anything at any point in time.  Therefore, we fall into what is called "our nature".  There are ways to erase all patterns and remain with fresh perception every single moment.  There are ways to understand things not with our patterns but with fresh intelligence.  This is the essence of the Yoga Sutras - techniques of Yoga delivered by Sage Patanjali thousands of years ago.</small><br>
				   <small><i>Paramahamsa Nithyananda</i> talks on Patanjali's Yoga Sutras to the modern man.  He explains how when the power of right understanding happens in an individual, all difficulties related to life simply dissolve.</small><br>
				   <br>
				   <b>March 12 (Thursday) 7pm-10pm</b><br>
				   <b>Topic:</b> Illumine Your Comprehension - Perceive Properly!<br>
				   <small>The mind has the ability to build anything out of anything. It can make or break people. It can cause illusions like nothing else can. It can glorify or defame a situation. That is its strength and its weakness. To clearly comprehend anything, we need to rise above the play of the mind. Only then we can see what really lies before us. That is the real capacity; that is true intelligence.</small><br>
				   <small><i>Paramahamsa Nithyananda</i> talks on Sage Patanjali's Yoga Sutras in the context of "right comprehension". He teaches us how to rise above the mind and see what IS!</small><br>
