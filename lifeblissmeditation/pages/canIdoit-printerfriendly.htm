                        Can Meditate Successfully</h1>        
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:12.75pt" align="justify"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

                        involve effort or concentration, you’ll be pleasantly 
                        surprised with the Life Bliss meditation. It’s one of 
                        the easiest things you’ll ever learn. There’s no 
                        effort involved—just a simple step by step procedure 
                        that lets the body and mind slip into deeper states of 
                        relaxation and rejuvenation.</span></p>
                        <h1 style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 16px; COLOR: #003468">Why
                        The Life Bliss Meditation Is So Easy</h1>
                        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:12.75pt" align="justify"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana">What
                        <em>is</em> the natural state of the mind? Most times it
                        seems like the nature of the mind is to wander,
                        constantly moving from one thought to another. The mind
                        oscillates between thoughts from the past or the future.
                        This brings immense stress due to regrets from the past
                        or anxiety about the future. <o:p>

                        is born a blissful being, but loses this state rapidly
                        due to various external factors that condition the mind
                        and disrupt this true nature. Bliss is the true nature
                        of every being. Enjoying the present moment to the
                        fullest is our birth right. There is an unconscious
                        constant yearning to connect to this source of bliss
                        that is hidden deep within us. Layers of mental patterns
                        and emotional disturbances act as barriers when we try
                        to reach this ocean of bliss. <o:p>

                        to the ocean of bliss enables us enjoy immense        
                        creativity, energy, and intelligence available within        
                        each one of us. We only need to present the opportunity        
                        to connect to our source of bliss and move inwards        
                        towards it.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        removes an obstacle which then naturally allows the        
                        bliss energy to gush forth helping us relax and        
                        rejuvenate the body and mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

                        our true nature is the first step in realizing and        
                        experiencing the ocean of joy within us. A glimpse of        
                        this bliss can only help you move deeper and deeper        
                        helping you establish in it forever. It’s just like        
                        diving—all we need to do is take the correct angle,        
                        and gravity does the rest.<o:p>

                        simply need a technique to start that process
