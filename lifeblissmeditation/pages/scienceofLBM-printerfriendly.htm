                  first like to give a brief background about how this  
                  revelation happened to me. Post enlightenment, I was in  
                  silence for an extended amount of time (months may be), when I  
                  was doing research on meditation techniques, to see how I can  
                  reproduce the same experience that happened in me, onto  
                  others. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">I came up with around hundred different meditation
                  techniques through all my programs and each meditation
                  technique was an attempt to raise the individual consciousness
                  by working on some aspect of the being.<o:p>

                  technique that I would recommend for everybody; which they can
                  practice daily. This question was raised again and again. And
                  I began to ponder deeply to come up with a technique which is
                  a complete representation of my philosophy, teachings and my
                  experience. <o:p>

                  holistic and complete by itself and instead of focusing on any  
                  particular aspect of the being; it should work on the entire  
                  being to transform it and make is ready for the ultimate  
                  experience to dawn. And one day, this meditation, Life Bliss  
                  Meditation (Nithya Dhyaan) was revealed to me in a flash. In  
                  an instant I could clearly see the different components of  
                  this technique; how each one relates to the other. I could  
                  clearly visualize in my inner space how this would help raise

                        The mind tends to revolt as it does not want to be 
                        quietened. It has been habituated to maintain a constant 
                        stream of thoughts for so many years. In fact people 
                        often complain that in an attempt to be thoughtless, 
                        they encounter more thoughts. Any initial attempt to 
                        make it silent is like swimming opposite to the river

                        the practice of meditation since they get discouraged. 
                        They think that meditation is not possible at all for

                        inner chatter reduces, you start progressing towards a 
                        deep restful thoughtless awareness. You start 
                        experiencing a different dimension of your being. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">Our body and the mind are mostly out of sync. 
                        While our body has its own innate intelligence guiding 
                        it all the time, it’s the mind that refuses to 
                        corroborate with that intelligence. The mind forces the 
                        body into certain actions which later on manifests as a 
                        disease. Disease here means absence of ease ( in the 
                        body ) . If the body is made to run forcibly, then it is 
                        going to revolt some time or the other. Many a times we 
                        tend to overeat. The body sends out signals that it is 
                        full but the mind is not satisfied. It wants more. And 
                        we end up eating more creating more and more damage to 
                        the body. The repercussions of this action are then felt 
                        later. So creating a harmony between the body and the 
                        mind is very essential to go beyond both. Else we would 
                        be caught in this psycho-physical entity and 
                        transcendence would be difficult. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">We have seven key energy centers in our body that 
are associated with specific emotions in our being. These emotions in turn are a 
result of the deep rooted engraved memories or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">samskaara </i>which have been accumulated from the past. These <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">samskaara</i> 
block the particular energy center causing physical and mental disturbances. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">When the energy centers get unblocked from 
negative emotions and then we start emitting positive emotions like love and 
compassion. Many of our diseases are psychosomatic. They have their roots in the 
mind. What we see is its effect and so we never really understand this mind-body 
connection. When a particular energy center gets blocked, the part of the body 
near that energy center gets affected. You might have seen that when you worry 
too much there is sense of tightness around the stomach region or the stomach 
gets upset. So it is important to keep the energy centers cleansed for good 
physical and mental health. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">Emotions like fantasies, imaginations, fear,  
worry, attention need, jealousy, ego and discontentment have negative existence.  
If you are asked to take an object out of the room, all you have to do is to  
pick up the object and take it out. So in this case the object has positive  
existence. But let us say that there is a dark room and you are asked to take  
the darkness out of room. You cannot really carry the darkness out of the room.  
Because here, darkness has a negative existence and cannot be removed  
physically. You just have to turn-on the light to dispel or remove the darkness.  
All these negative emotions also have a negative existence just like the  
darkness in the room. Bringing awareness and understanding about the system of  
energy centers can help eliminate negative emotions. This naturally allows the  
positive emotions to flow and radiate. <o:p>

slowly untied the knot. Buddha then explained that if you have to untie the knot 
of ignorance in your being, you first have to learn to observe and examine it 
carefully. You have to flood your being with awareness and the negativity will 
be instantaneously obliterated.<o:p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">The mind is nothing but a collection of thoughts. 
These thoughts rise up in succession like the bubbles in a fish tank. All these 
thoughts that rise in the mind also appear to be connected. But just like the 
bubbles in the fish tank the thoughts in the mind are also independent and 
unconnected. <o:p>
</o:p>

text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">You can do a small exercise. For ten minutes sit 
silently and observe the thoughts that arise in your mind. Don’t try to 
control or stop thinking. Just be silent and witness the thoughts coming. The 
moment a thought comes quickly write it down on paper. At the end of ten minutes 
read out whatever is written. You will see that it’s a mad man’s diary. 
There is utter chaos. There is no connection between the previous thought and 
the next one. All the thoughts are un-clutched and unconnected. Only when you 
write down your thoughts you come to know that the thoughts have no real 
connection. You may be thinking about having a cup of coffee and the next moment 
you may think about some office work which is pending. There is no real 
connection between having a cup of tea and the office work. Both are independent 
events. Even if there are two consecutive thoughts about the same event the 
thoughts are unconnected as there is no continuity. There exists a silent gap 
between these thoughts of which one is not aware. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none" align="left"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">The thoughts by their very nature are un-clutched.           
The problem starts when we start connecting these thoughts. When these           
independent and unconnected thoughts are linked up, we create illusions of           
pleasure or pain based on the nature of thoughts that we choose to link -up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is a play of the mind that is constantly happening within us. <o:p>          
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none" align="left"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">For example; you might have eaten ice cream ten 
years ago, you might have eaten ice cream seven years ago and you might have 
eaten ice cream two years ago and you might have eaten ice cream yesterday. All 
these experiences might have been very pleasurable for you. You might have 
enjoyed the ice cream on each of that occasion. The trouble starts when these 
experiences are connected and an imaginary shaft or an understanding is created 
that eating ice cream makes you happy. But sometime in the future eating ice 
cream may not be as enjoyable as on the earlier occasions. Even if you don’t 
enjoy the ice cream you will make yourself believe that you like the ice cream. 
Because you have got into the habit of connecting the thoughts; you 
unconsciously start accepting that you enjoy ice cream. Here the imaginary joy 
is one aspect of the illusion while the other is the recording of the false 
emotion deep within you. Similarly so many such incidents and thoughts are 
connected and recorded as illusions rather than as independent moments of pain 
or pleasure. <o:p>
</o:p>

text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">Similar is the case with painful experiences. The 
pain which you experienced ten years ago, the pain which you experiences seven 
years ago, the pain which you experienced three years ago and the pain which you 
experienced yesterday are independent events. There is no connection between 
these events. But through connecting events of similar nature you are creating a 
shaft that gives you the feeling of prolonged agony. This will leave you feeling 
that your life has been miserable and painful all along. Similarly connecting 
all the pleasurable experiences in your life gives you the feeling that that 
your life is pleasure. <o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">But actually neither of it is true. Your life is 
neither pleasure nor pain because the very process of connecting these events is 
a mistake. The idea that the thoughts are connected is a misconception. 
Ironically we don’t connect all the thoughts. We only connect those that we 
remember and create the shaft. It is similar to how a bouquet is created by 
picking just a few flowers from a garden. <o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">When we create the shaft we suffer. If you have           
created a shaft of pleasure we try to extend it because you want to experience           
the same pleasure again. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But if you           
have created a shaft of pain then you try to break it because you want to avoid           
the pain. You can neither extend the shaft nor break it because it never existed           
in the first place. The shaft itself is a myth. <o:p>          
</o:p>          
</span></p>

text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">All your experiences are independent experiences. 
The moment you have connected these experiences you have created suffering too. 
Now you will understand why suffering is also imaginary. It is based on 
something imaginary. It is based on something unreal. It’s just an appearance. 
The shaft is unreal; it does not exist. So the suffering that is created due to 
the shaft is also unreal. Once you realize this you are liberated. So by our 
very nature we are un-clutched. We are enlightened and just we have to realize 
it.<o:p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Verdana">When we perceive every incident is a new incident 
we see life in a more beautiful way. Everything seems joyful and blissful. You 
stop taking things for granted. Once you start accepting life from moment to 
moment, bliss happens to you naturally. <o:p>

that your thoughts are unconnected, irrational and un-clutched. There is no 
horizontal connection between your thoughts. Even if you have thoughts neither 
try to suppress the thoughts nor try to react to them. Just watch them with the 
understanding that they are un-clutched. Automatically witnessing consciousness 
will start happening in you. You will go beyond the two identities. You will 
realize that you are neither the shaft of pleasure nor the shaft of pain but you
