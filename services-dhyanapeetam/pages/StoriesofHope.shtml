              I am a woman of 50 yrs, and was suffering from Asthma for the past 10 - 12 years. I was unable to eat well, lift heavy things or take a long walk. I always complained of indigestion, severe cough with blood, severe backache and lot of tiredness, which made me a very weak person. Tried all the best possible treatments like Ayurvedic, Homeopathy, Allopathy, Kotaikal etc., but could relieve myself of this problem only for a short period.<br>
              <br>
              Only a miracle could cure me permanently from these ailments and that "MIRACLE" did happen to me in the form of Swamiji who cured me through healing and meditation. I met him for the first time on the occasion of Padhapoojai. I started taking the treatment of healing and meditated regularly for about 15 days and I am still continuing. I am now a fit person who is able to do all sorts of work, be it lifting heavy thing or take a long morning walk which I was unable to do before. This healing &amp; Meditation has made my health fit and my mind strong. I can proudly say that I am now one among the Healers who can help people come out of their ailments.<br>
              <br>
              I am very thankful to our Swamiji whom I regard as God.<br>

It all started in July 2007, when I rushed to the Gynecologist with very slight pain in the pelvic, she put me on antibiotics and after two months in vain,
              suggested a biopsy.  The diagnosis was Polypoidal Cervicitis. I was asked to
              undergo a hysterectomy. (removal of the uterus). I went in for a second
              opinion, she too suggested surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              I was amazed at my calm when I heard these words, the feeling within was so strong, I knew
              <i> I would be healed</i>.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              I agreed outwardly for a surgery in December 2007, but waited calmly, as if something would happen.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>BEFORE HEALING-<br>
              </b>I had pain from my hips which would extend to my feet. I could not stand
              continuously for more than 7 to 10 minutes. The pain would worsen terribly on some days, I would almost feel like giving up my resolution.  I had no assurance that I would be healed, only the gut feel and faith.  My stamina was failing.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              During a public darshan at Swami’s program, he told me &quot;We shall wait, we shall
              heal&quot; (wait pannalam ma, heal pannalam ma.)  His words were my weapon, my reassurance, my renewal of faith.  I waited endlessly…………for what, I did not know.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile, I meditated almost everyday and gave healing to myself.  When I could, I would receive healing from some other healer.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It was around the 10th of March, I woke up one morning to find that my physical and mental energies had hit the bottom, the pain and fear were getting unbearable. I did not want to do anything,  I literally dragged myself to work, once I was there I managed through the day, this would repeat every day.  I heard that Swami was giving healing to the public from 1st March at the ashram.  I could not carry on any longer, even my daily chores of cooking, etc., were a terrible effort and painful.  I went to see Swami on the 15th March 2008 and stayed at the Ashram to receive healing for ten days.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>DURING HEALING -&nbsp;</b><br>
              I have tried to put in words very briefly, what I experienced at the ashram, words are no substitute, I still cry and feel so touched when I go through my experiences every time.  The banyan tree which I experienced as so loving, touching and healing, I felt like there was an army carrying me through and consoling me, pains and hunger would disappear, answers to many questions would roll in, I would space out, every moment was treasured, precious…………………., the loving and caring people around you, the music was soothing, tasty lunch, cooked so lovingly………………and the healing, caring, compassionate……………loving touch.  Shiva sutras every evening, what more could one want in life I often mused.  I yearned for a place for my tired soul to rest and he rested me in a haven which was heaven.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              With all this, I was also brought to face my fears, my innate patterns, my doubts, my anger with myself, the inability to forgive myself, he held a mirror before me and I was looking within.  I laid all this and more at his feet.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              As each day progressed, there were differences in my body, the pain increased and spread to my whole body and then suddenly dissipated.  I was overwhelmed with gratitude, I felt lighter and lighter as if I had lost a lot of weight, my stomach which had bulged due to all the wounds and infection, suddenly deflated like a balloon.  On the last day, my clothes hung loose on me.  I stood before Swami, with renewed confidence, no fear, contented for every moment that I had lived in the ashram, ready to take on life as it comes, energetic, enthusiastic, rejuvenated, full of love for every being and a love for life, the wisdom to accept what I could not change and the courage to change what I could.  It did not matter to me if I had been healed or not, I had experienced such richness in every moment, pain or no pain, I had learnt many a lesson and am to learn many, many more.  I bid a tearful farewell, though deep down I understood it was for me to find this bliss wherever I went.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>AFTER HEALING-&nbsp;</b><br>
              I visited the doctor after I came back from the ashram, she was amazed with how I had been healed and certified that I was fine and was to visit her only after a year,
              <b><u> there was no need for any surgery!</u></b><br>
              <br>
              I feel ten years younger now, more stamina, the pain that would extend from my hip to my legs disappeared, I am able to walk long distances, stand for longer hours and even dance.  My awareness and consciousness has
              sharpened.<br>
              <br>
              I am much much more humane now, a child at heart, ……………………..in deep gratitude to all that I have received and learnt and continue to learn, from the time Swami came into my life six years ago.  Gurubhyo

              With absolute faith, trust and devotion, I went to have darshan of Shri Nithyananda Swamiji. I am 69 yrs old man having severe pain in both my knees.<br>
              <br>
 Swamiji's benevolent look and benediction made me feel reassured and happy. He spoke to me with compassion and concern and touched my left knee for a few minutes. He also touched my chest for a minute and assured me that energy is flowing properly through my Anahatha Chakra. I had an open-heart surgery in May 2002.<br>
              <br>
              After coming out of the darshan hall, the severe pain in my left knee simply vanished. Consequently, I attended healing sessions for about 10 days, which made the pain in my right knee also, disappear.<br>
              <br>
              It was a miracle of Swamiji's divine grace and unconditional compassion for which I am ever grateful to him. I humbly pray to him that he may heal more and more people in the emotional, spiritual and physical levels.<br>
              <br>

              My wife was suffering from very severe low back pain and neck pain for 8 long years, which according to the doctors was due to wear and tear in the bones (Degenerative
              osteoarthritis). Several analgesic tablets did not provide any relief.<br>
              <br>
              We decided to see Swami Nithyananda and derive benefit from his unique spiritual healing technique, which is devoid of side effects. After about 15 sittings, my wife derived complete recovery from the pain and discomfort. We were amazed at the improvement she received without side effects. We are thankful to Swamiji for all his help.<br>

            <div id="dd" style="DISPLAY: none; PADDING-LEFT: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="3"><br/>
 I was diagnosed to be suffering from chronic renal failure. Initially, I was treated as an inpatient at a reputed hospital to bring down my potassium level, which was very high. I was told, rather curtly, by the doctor that I was born with only one kidney and the remaining left kidney was also small in size and functioning below 25% level and it was a gradually deteriorating case. I was in despair and faithfully followed strict dietary restrictions and medication. Inspite of this, the symptoms like vomiting, nausea, edema, breathlessness etc. were there, and I was rushed to a reputed private hospital for emergency treatment. I was administered life saving medication in a week with dialysis. My agonizing days started thereon with dialysis for three days in a week with each session lasting for four hours. Kidney transplantation started haunting me.<br>
              <br>
              I was looking for every conceivable opportunity to get some healing touch. The God of healing heard my plea and I was referred to the healing powers of Swami
              Nithyananda by a family friend and I finally got an opportunity to attend the healing camp of Swamiji. I was immensely impressed by the charismatic profile of Swamiji and was convinced of the divine powers of Swamiji. I narrated the nature of my problem and Swamiji just said "Gods grace is there on you, have courage you will be healed, there is hope". I was mesmerized by his assurance and I got the healing touch by the lord of healing. It was a strange feeling. I felt some heat energy entering my body. It was after 5 days of healing, I wished to place on record the improvement in my health condition. The hemoglobin level, which was precariously low at 6.4g/dl rose to 8.2g/dl and the uric acid, reached the normal level of 6mg/dl within the short span of healing. More than anything, I started feeling energetic throughout the day. I now look forward eagerly to the remaining days of healing, and
              am confident that the God of Healing Swami Nithyananda will definitely cure my renal problem.<br>

 I was struck with Hepatitis B (jaundice) in 1995 and suffered with no respite for six long years. My appetite during this time deteriorated completely and my digestion completely collapsed. My family tried every available system of medicine but there was no cure. Even the doctors gave up hope. I was living then only on a diet of rava kanji (flour soup). I knew that death was around the corner.<br><br>

On my friend's suggestion, I agreed to see this Swamiji who was then healing at his Erode Ashram. On the very first meeting I felt a bond was established and I knew without doubt that I would be healed. Swamiji lovingly touched my heart and voiced that I would be fine. He then asked me to put a pinch of the sacred ash into everything I ate and drank for the next three days.<br><br>

I followed this instruction and on the 3rd day itself my stomach began to feel fine after six long years. Immediately, Swamiji instructed me to eat rice, green chilies and a full South Indian meal and I complied with it. Tears of joy rolled down my face coupled with a feeling of complete blessedness.<br><br>

Out of complete gratitude and surrender, I asked Swami Sri Nithyananda Paramahamsa if I could serve as his secretary at the ashram, which Swamiji accepted. Even today I am in good health and bliss and ever ready to serve my divine master. Jai Guru!<br><br>

I am an agent for healthcare products. In November 2002, I felt giddy and got admitted to Salem Gokulam Hospital . It came as a terrible shock when I was diagnosed with brain hemorrhage. My wife contacted Sri Nithyananda Swami. He promised my wife, ‘Just keep your confidence up. I'll take care of him.<br><br>

The same day, I was shifted to Sri Ramachandra Multi-specialty Hospital . Even then the doctors said that since I was in the fifth stage of coma, there was very little hope of recovery. Swamiji came immediately to the hospital and gave me courage and healing. In 12 hours, I amazed doctors with an unexpected improvement. Later the doctors performed open surgery and corrected the hemorrhage. These operations are successful only rarely, but in my case it was. <br><br>

Swamiji flew from Bangalore to Chennai everyday just to give me healing. This went on for ten days. Now I'm perfectly fine. My recovery can be termed a medical miracle. I salute Swami Nithyananda for giving me this new birth!<br><br>

  My name is Lakshmi. I am 30 years old. I live here in a nearby village. I used to go to a private hospital before I found out about this camp from the announcements. In the beginning i was a little afraid, thinking the doctors would be careless since its free. But once i bought my daughter here for some treatment, I was very happy with the way the doctors treated my girl with so much care. She was healed quickly. After that i never went to the private hospital. They are very expensive. We cant go there without
              at least 100rs with us. Also, in those hospitals they gave us treatment, but
              didn't treat us well. More than anything else, its the way they treat us that matters. Here in this medical camp, rich or poor, they treat us very well.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              What other facilities can we provide you, which will help you more?<br>
              Instead of once a week, if you could make it 24 hrs service it would be great. If you have a hospital with all these
              facilities and service it would even more helpful for us, so we don't
              have to go anywhere else. Now for emergencies we have to go to the private hospitals. If the problem is such that we can wait until the weekend, we wait. Otherwise we go to the private hospitals which costs us a lot of money. For complications or surgery we have to go to Bangalore city. We take a bus and go to Bangalore.<br>

  I am retired 70 year old woman who used to work for the health care department. We have a
          government hospital close by, but its not that good. The private hospitals are expensive are not affordable to the poor people. This medical camp is a blessing for all of us, since its giving free medical consultation and free medicines. It would be great if there were lab facilities also, so some of the tests could be done here itself.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The other hospitals and labs around here are very expensive. Its not possible to afford for the poor.
          For a simple blood test or urine test they charge 100 Rs. Its not at all affordable to the poor who's one days earning itself is that much. After working hard from morning till evening they earn something like 50 to 100Rs. And if they fall sick they not only suffer physically they also have to take a loan just to go and get medicines from the hospital. After you started this free medical camp, its been a great help to the poor.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It would be great if you could also build a hospital. The government hospitals close by
          don't have so many facilities. Only the consultation is free. We have to go to the pharmacy and buy the medication, which is expensive. Sometimes, if we cant afford them, we
          don't buy them.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              If you can build us a free hospital it would be great. For the past 2 years you have been doing so much providing consultation and medicines. Not only that you are also serving us free food. There are so many facilities being offered already. We are just requesting you, if its possible, it would be nice if you could also build us a hospital with all these
          facilities in it.<br>

They have so many things to take care of at home. They have work at home, since this is the only day they get a day off. They have kids to take care of, cows that need to be milked etc.. if you get a mobile dispensary and come during the week to the villages it would be a great help to the villagers.<br>

			<br/>I have always wondered what the original system of yoga is. 
			There are so many types of yoga available in the West, but most of 
			them deal with physical well-being and don’t go any deeper. Now that 
			I have learned Nithya Yoga and experienced it, I can boldly and 
			proudly claim that it is the most amazing, complete, and 
			transformational yoga system I’ve seen. And coming from the 
			consciousness of an enlightened master, Nithya Yoga is a 
			re-revealing of the original system of yoga as given by Patanjali.
			<br>
			<br>
			I cannot imagine a greater gift to mankind than the system of Nithya 
			Yoga revealed by Paramahamsa Nithyananda. It will allow everyone, <i>
			and I mean everyone</i>, to live a much more blissful life, to 
			experience fulfillment not only in the Nithya Yoga session itself, 
			but also in their day-to-day activities, whatever they may be doing. 
			With Nithya Yoga, even very simple body movements during the day 
			bring out the joy which is recorded in the muscle memory from the 
			yoga sessions.<br>
