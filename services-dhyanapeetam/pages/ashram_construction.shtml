                                          &nbsp;tremendous 
											benefit to thousands around the 
											world. Our regular meditation 
											workshops such as Ananda Spurna 
											Program, Nithyananda Spurana 
											Program, Bhakti Spurana Program etc 
											have been happening in parallel in 
											our Ashram and in various cities 
											across India. Every month more than 
											500 people attend these meditation 
											camps in Bidadi and more than 1000 
											attend all over India. It is 
											heartening to see the transformation 
											and healing that the programs and 
											services bring to so many people of 
											all backgrounds.<br>
											<br>
											Our special events are always a 
											unique opportunity for both regular 
											and new participants to partake in 
											the blissful celebrations. Major 
											festivals like Guru Poornima are 
											usually attended by more than 20,000 
											people. In Gurupurnima 2008 We 
											served 75,000 free meals to people. 
											More than 500 people attended our 
											Navarathri celebrations every day 
											for ten days. We also offered 
											spiritual counseling and healing 
											services free of cost to everyone. 
											The Kalpataru Darshans and
											<a href="healing_projbrief.shtml"><font color="#000080"> Healing 
											Services</font></a> drew more than 1500 people 
											every week. We continue to offer 
											<a href="med_projbrief.shtml"><font color="#000080">free medical camps</font></a> services for 
											those who cannot economically afford 
											medical checkup, treatment or 
											diagnosis. In the last 5 months, we 
											have conducted more than 25 camps 
											across Bidadi and about 50 camps all 
											over India. Each camp helps medical 
											services reach out to about 250 
											people who wouldn't have been able 
											to afford it otherwise. These camps 
											also offer various specialist 
											consultations, diagnosis and 
											treatment options that are not 
											economically viable to many. For the 
											past 2 months our mobile dispensary 
											has been making the rounds across 50 
											villages in and around Bidadi 
											reaching out to people who are not 
											able to come to the medical camps.
											<br>
											<br>
											We offer a free 2 year 
											residential program called 
											<a href="lbt_projectbrief.shtml"><font color="#000080">Life 
											Bliss Technology</font></a> for youth aged 
											between 18 and 30. The thrust of the 
											program is to help youth from all 
											types of socio-economic backgrounds 
											to become self-supporting and 
											confident in facing life and 
											excelling in whatever field they may 
											choose. It provides an intense 
											atmosphere for the youth to grow in 
											both inner and outer worlds with 
											focus on Yoga, Meditation and Self 
											Improvement (Vocational skills). The 
											training is customized to each 
											individual participant's aptitude 
											and ability, and includes staying in 
											different branches of our 
											organization completely free of 
											cost. We have seen measurable 
											success with our program. So far, we 
											have had more than 300 students 
											undergo this program free of cost. 
											There are currently 150 students 
											enrolled in the program and the 
											demand for this program is 
											increasing. To provide for the needs 
											of this program, we need various 
											facilities such as more 
											accommodation, office space, 
											classroom, a better library, 
											meditation halls, yoga studios and 
											computer facility developed and 
											improved in our ashram.</p>

											We are glad to let you know that we 
											are making progress in improving our 
											infrastructure facilities although 
											there is still a long way to go in 
											terms of meeting our growing needs. 
											We have already successfully 
											completed a 100 bed dormitory with 
											toilet facilities. During season, we 
											have on average of more than 200 
											visitors per day on regular days and 
											we serve more than 1500 meals per 
											day. With&nbsp;our current 
											facilities we are able to 
											accommodate only 150 people to stay 
											comfortably in the Ashram. However, 
											the demand is far greater and is 
											ever increasing. In order to 
											continue to provide our services at 
											the same quality towards the benefit 
											of tens of thousands of people, we 
											need better infrastructure 
											facilities. We are in the process of 
											building a 1000 bed dormitory with 
											Toilet facilities.
