                  <h3>Ongoing flood relief operations in Karnataka  </h3>
                    <p>The first group of the flood relief volunteers of Nithyananda Global Initiatives (NGCI) comprising of the Mysore and Mandya team returned late last night after distributing the relief material and taking stock of the situation.                      </p>
                    <p>The team took with them close to 10 tons of relief material worth Rs. 6, 00,000 comprising of food, utensils, cooking material and clothes in a canter vehicle for the flood victims.                      </p>
                    <p>Following is an account from by one of the NGCI volunteers who served onsite.
                      
                      <br>
                      “Going by the news reports, it was understood that raichur district was the worst affected. Accordingly, we established contact with the special officer in charge of flood relief, who in turn guided us to the asst. commissioner of the area, who in turn directed us to the taluk office of Sindhanur taluka, which was among the worst affected. We reached the said office on 12th afternoon and were directed by the junior officials to a village called Attigudda, coming under Turvihala police station limits. We distributed about 270 ration packs here, amidst great confusion and bad crowd management. However it did not appear that the village was affected by the rising river floods.                      </p>
                    <p>Next morning, having gathered sufficient information from the local people that three other villages were totally devastated, we went first to a village called: OLA BELLARY. This place was totally affected. We established contact with a local mutt there called Suvarnagiri Virakta Mutt and met the Swamiji there by name Sri Siddalinga Mahaswami, who arranged for peaceful distribution of the family packs.                      </p>
                    <p>The local villagers thereafter directed us to the next village called Hediganalu ( 170 families). This village is remotely accessed and the villagers are living in tents, in a different area, as the complete village was submerged in 30 feet of water. This was the worst that we saw. Not one house is left standing, and the entire village has been washed away, as can be seen in the photographs (http://services.dhyanapeetam.org/flood-relief2009-KA.shtml). However, the good thing is that there is no loss of human life. Along with a UNICEF coordinator, we distributed family packs and clothing to all the families.                      </p>
                    <p>We were then guided to the next village, CHINTAMANDODDI, (163 families). This village too, had totally disappeared. The people are now living in tents on the roadside. Here we distributed the remaining food packs and clothes, bread, etc”                      </p>
