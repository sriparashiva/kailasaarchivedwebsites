Unless we create a critical mass of enlightened people, we can't think of saving the planet earth, because so many calamities are happening around the world, which are created by the unconscious human beings - global warming, HIV, religious terrorism, fanaticism and so many atomic weapons getting piled. We are facing today so many dangers. <br/>
                      <br/>
                      We need to create a peaceful, blissful, joyful understanding and an enlightened society, enlightened humanity to save planet earth. This will lead to inner world success and outer world productivity. <br/>
                      <br/>
                      In my nine years of wandering, I searched for a place where I could learn under one umbrella the technology of blissful living. But I never found such a place. I found the knowledge in bits and pieces in various parts of the country. That is why it took me nine years to pick up the technology. <br/>
                      <br/>
                      When I attained inner bliss, the first thing I wanted to do was make available this technology for the next generations under one roof. Out of this inspiration, I created the Life Bliss Technology which provides an ambience to help anybody pick up the technology of life bliss.&quot;<br/>

                  Over 300 students have taken part in this intense self-development program, of which 248 students felt so touched and inspired that they decided to stay back and help the foundation in its mission to serve humanity. The other 52 students went back and found jobs in a life made richer in the internal and the external world. <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Currently, the foundation takes care of more than 300 LBT students at its centers across the globe. It imparts the students with the training in their chosen field while providing food, shelter, clothing and money to help them lead a comfortable life.                &nbsp;</font></td>

                  With the support of the foundation, young adults from different states in India and other countries are developing marketable skills in the area of meditation therapy and life solutions; school dropouts are becoming young entrepreneurs; gaining leadership skills; organizing and executing skills in varied fields like Travel study programs, music concerts, e-commerce, book publishing houses, hotel management and much more. The spiritual and vocational training extended to these young adults provide them with the resources or expertise to effectively address the challenges facing today’s young people. The thrust of the program is to help youth from all types of socio-economic backgrounds to become self-supporting and confident in facing life and excelling in whatever field they may choose.<br/>
