                  through its Nithyananda Global Initiatives has been conducting meditation programs in the prisons for the past 2 years. The meditation workshop comprises of meditation techniques that help an individual heal the negative emotions within themselves. In these camps, we have seen that most often the prisoners are suffering from mental traumas, guilt, anger towards themselves, towards the society, frustration with their present situation, and a feeling of revenge. They struggle with these emotions and not being able to manage their life. They carry this struggle in their system even after they are released and back in the society. The meditation workshops are looking towards helping these individuals look at themselves and life in a fresh perspective bringing forth a confidence in them that will make them constructive participants in society.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  <img src="../images/web.archive.org/web/20100708070657im_/http%EF%B9%95/services.dhyanapeetam.org/images/prison/asp_coimbatore_central_prison.jpg" alt="Meditation programs in prison" width="334" height="268" align="left"/>We have enclosed as testimonials a few of the feedback we have received from the participants during the workshops. These include poetry and letters of overflowing gratitude and peace of mind from the participants. While we wish to spread the message of meditation and make a difference in the life’s of the people, we have been hard pressed for want of adequate resources to take these workshops to various prisons across the country. We hope to bring about a positive change in society through the message of meditation which we believe is the only answer to the growing violence in the present world. Among our various approaches towards this vision, is conducting free meditation camps in prisons.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  We are looking for organizations such as yours that will provide us with the much needed funding in this effort. We welcome your participation of any kind in this mission, and invite you to experience some of the meditation workshops conducted by the
                  acharyas “teachers” of the organization. We have meditation workshops designed exclusively for the busy individuals in the corporate sector and we would be more than happy to present them to members of your organization. With this we hope to bring about a two-fold benefit, one: in introducing the meditation workshops and giving you an experience of how we conduct them and at the same time giving you a glimpse of the various workshops offered by the organization.

                  We have included a sample cost of conducting the meditation camp in a prison in the city of Salem in
                  Tamil Nadu state in India. Following that is an estimate for conducting one such camp every week in the various cities across south India in the next six months. We hope to increase the reach to more cities in the future and look forward to a continuing partnership with you in our effort.<br>
