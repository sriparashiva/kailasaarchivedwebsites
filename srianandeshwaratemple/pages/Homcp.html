              <td width="100%" height="396" colspan="2" valign="top" bgcolor="#D9B9AC"><p align="justify">More than 1000 years ago, a <em>swayambu linga</em> (naturally formed Shiva linga)  was worshipped by the villagers in  Bidadi village in the outskirts of Bengaluru city in India. A number of ritualistic offerings and prayers were done by the villagers who regularly visited this <em>linga</em>. 600 years ago, a sacred banyan tree grew at this very spot, providing shelter for the <em>swayambu linga</em>. A naturally formed cave can be seen at the foot of the banyan tree. A <em>rishi </em>- sage - called Munishwar lived and meditated in this cave. After many many years, he attained <em>samadhi</em> in this very spot. The villagers felt a very powerful energy present in that place. Their prayers were answered and all their wishes granted. When the villagers came here to offer their prayers, they felt great peace and serenity within and without. All the following generations of these villagers continued worshipping this powerful <em>swayambu linga</em>. The existence of this <em>swayambu linga </em>was known only to these villagers, not to the entire world at that time. </p>
                <p align="justify">Paramahamsa Nithyananda an enlightened master from South India, had a vision of this sacred Banyan tree and the <em>swayambu linga </em>soon after his enlightenment. On coming to this place with a few of his disciples, Paramahamsa stated that this was the same tree he had seen in his vision. He narrated to his disciples about the significance of the <em>swayambu linga </em>and the importance of it in the villagers' life. He also said that over 1000 years ago, there was an organisation called Dhyanapeetam that existed in this place which the villagers used to be part of. As this was known only to the villagers, Paramahamsa decided to reconstruct this organisation as Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam so that the greatness of this <em>linga </em>and the sacred Banyan tree will spread world wide. </p>
                <p align="justify"><strong>A <em>Bhoomi puja</em> (offering to Mother Earth) was conducted by Paramahamsa himself on this very spot. </strong>After the <em>Bhoomi Puja</em> and grand inauguration of Nithyananda Dhyanapeetam on 1 January 
                  2003, work started on the land with the guidance 
                of <strong>Paramahamsa</strong>.</p>
                <p align="justify">Paramahamsa installed an idol of Lord Dakshinamurti under the sacred Banyan tree. He did the <em>prana pratishta</em> (giving life to the idol) himself.</p>
                <p align="center" class="style2">Chitram Vatathaormula<br/>
                  vrudha shishya guruyuva<br/>

                  shishyastu chinnasamsaya.</p>
                <p align="justify"><span class="style3">What a wonder! This vision under the Banyan tree! The teacher is a young lad, the taught are older men! The teacher is silent, yet the doubts of the disciples are dissolved! </span></p>
                <p align="justify" class="style6">Over a thousand years ago, Shankara sang the praises of the young Master Dakshinamurti teaching his far older disciples in silence under a Banyan tree.This statment of Shankara happens in reality in the ashram. Under a magnificient Banyan tree, Paramahamsa Nithyananda leads a group of men and women in prayer, meditation and discourse. </p>
                <p align="justify">Within a few months of discovering the land, the ashram started getting built. Currently, the ashram encompasses: 
                        quarters for the ashramites, ladies' and gents' 
                        dormitories, a food temple to serve food for all, a 
                        library with a collection of rare books to quench the 
                        thirst of the spiritually aspiring mind, publication and 
                        office buildings, Ananda Sabha - a meditation hall, 
                Paramahamsa's <em>kuteer, </em>Temple of Sri Anandeshwar with a <em>yaga mandir </em>(place for fire rituals) and <em>yoga mandir</em> (place for yoga), a Gurukul system of education, a free residential program for youth - Life Bliss Technology, Goshala - cow shelter, Nithya Kirtanalaya - music wing and more. </p>
                <p align="justify">On 1st January 2007, <strong>Paramahamsa </strong> performed 
                  a grand <em>kumbabhisheka </em>&ndash; first holy bath - to 
                  the temple of Sri Anandeshwar at the ashram in 
                  Bengaluru. </p>
                <p align="justify">Built with granite stone and along similar 
                    lines of the Arunachala temple of Tiruvannamalai, this 
                    temple is being built at a rapid pace with the love and 
                    devotion of devotees and disciples of <strong>Paramahamsa</strong>. It 
                    beholds an energy field pregnant with the Cosmic Energy. </p>
                <p align="justify">The presiding deities of the temple &ndash; Sri 
                  Anandeshwar and Anandeshwari, made out of the five 
                  metals namely: copper, bronze, measuring 7 &frac12; feet in 
                  height and weighing 2 &frac12; tons, went through a grand 
                  procession in South India, offering <em>darshan </em>to 
                  crores of people, before entering the temple. They were 
                  consecrated through <em>prana prathishta </em>&ndash; a method 
                  of consecration by which the Existential energy is 
                  instilled in the deities &ndash; by <strong>Paramahamsa</strong>, on 1st Jan 2007. Bearing the profound distinction of being consecrated 
                  by an enlightened master himself, these deities exude 
                  the Cosmic Energy, creating an atmosphere where mere 
                  existence is meditation. Just being here, heals one at 
                  the physical, mental and spiritual levels. </p>
                <p align="justify">This temple is the energy hub of the 
                  ashram. It offers a space for the spirit to soar and 
                  experience the all-pervading Energy. The energy field is 
                  strengthened through continuous spiritual practices by 
                  ordained <em>brahmacharis </em>of the ashram. Vedic 
                  chanting, powerful fire rituals, specially designed <em>pujas </em>and other offerings, happen here 
                  continuously. Up to 1008 varieties of food items are 
                  offered here on special occasions. </p>
                <p align="justify">Envisioned as a spiritual nerve center of 
                  the universe, this temple is already being celebrated 
                  and experienced by devotees and visitors with great 
                  devotion and zeal. </p>
                <p align="justify">Around the sanctum, work is proceeding to 
                  complete the temple structure and fulfill this grand 
                  vision. In order to expedite this process, you may
