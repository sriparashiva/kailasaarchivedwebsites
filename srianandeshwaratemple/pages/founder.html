        Arunachalam and Lokanayaki in <strong>Thiruvannamalai</strong>, home to Arunachala, 
        the spiritual heart center of our planet. On the tenth 
        day after his birth, an astrologer was summoned to cast 
        his horoscope and awed by the unique configuration of 
        planets in Nithyananda’s birthchart exclaimed that 
        Nithyananda would grow up to be a <em>Raja Sannyasi</em> (King among Swamis). <span class="Subhead"><strong>Early 
          Years</strong></span> re stone

        towering deity idols that grace the temples of Life 
        Bliss Foundation in North America and other countries 
        today. </p>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">In childhood as well 
        as throughout his wandering years, Nithyananda was 
        dTrue to the 
        astrologer's words, Rajasekaran showed spiritual 
        inclinations from a tender age. He would make idols out 
        of mud, clay and soap stone, decorate them and worship 
        them with a deep fervor. This aspect of Nithyananda’s 
        personality would remain unchanged; the miniatueeply inspired by two great saints of Bharat, Sri 
        Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi. A photograph of 
        Ramakrishna was the focus of Nithyananda’s worship 
        practices, and he was blessed to have had direct 
        darshan, or superconscious experience of Ramakrishna in 
        the flesh. His spiritual teachers in Thiruvannamalai 
        awakened Nithyananda’s enormous latent spiritual 
        potential. </p>

        Nithyananda in Yoga methods and processes that would 
        strengthen His body and mind, in preparation for the 
        Herculean tasks of today. Raghupati Yogi would emphasize 
        to Nithyananda that the optimal period, during which one 
        can truly imbibe the truths of Yoga so that they become 
        a solid experience, is before the age of 14; 
        accordingly, he trained Nithyananda starting from age 3 
        for a period of 10 full years. Raghupati Yogi taught 
        Nithyananda <em>asanas</em>, <em>pranayama</em>, <em>dhyana</em>, and also other esoteric Yogic methods, 
        including how to resist hunger and thirst, which would 
        prove to be invaluable during the intense<em> parivrajaka </em>years, or years of wandering as a 
        renunciant. Above all, Raghupati Yogi truly helped 
        prepare Nithyananda’s body to receive, hold, and express 
        the high energy of enlightenment.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="boxcontent"><span class="greylinktext"><em class="boxcontentbrown">Mataji 
        Kuppammal</em><br>
        </span>Another key teacher was Mataji 
        Kuppammal, who was a spiritual adept who had mastered 
        the mystical science of <em>Kundalini tantra </em>by the 
        age of 12. She became a great inspiration and a 
        compassionate guide to young Nithyananda. When 
        Nithyananda was around seven and was at the altar of 
        Goddess Parvati inside the Arunachaleshwara temple one 
        day, he suddenly had a vision of a golden colored 
        geometric figure, which he then immediately carved from 
        memory onto a copper sheet with a nail. Kuppammal 
        explained to him that what he had drawn was the very 
        powerful <em>Sri Chakra</em>, a complex and metaphorical 
        representation of the universal energy. Kuppammal then 
        initiated Nithyananda into the science of <em>tantra</em>, which uses the <em>Sri Chakra </em>as a 
        base for meditation practices.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="boxcontent">Kuppammal led Nithyananda from <em>bhakti </em>(devotion) into <em>jnana </em>(wisdom) 
        and <em>dhyana </em>(meditation), with the help of her 
        own Master, Isakki Swamigal, who also contributed to 
        Nithyananda’s growing realization. Kuppammal gave 
        Nithyananda many books and predicted that he would keep 
        these books till he himself started providing 
        commentaries on them based on his wisdom.</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="641" src="../images/web.archive.org/web/20100708062856im_/http%EF%B9%95/srianandeshwaratemple.dhyanapeetam.org/images/Kuppammal_Initiation.jpg" width="466"></p>
      <p align="justify" class="greylinktext"><em class="boxcontentbrown"><strong>Arunagiri Yogishwar</strong></em><br>
        The very first awareness of His own 
        inner nature, His very first brush with His incarnated 
        being, and the first revelation of His life’s mission, 
        happened to Nithyananda when he met with Arunagiri 
        Yogiswara, who is considered to be an incarnation of 
        Lord Siva Himself, at age nine. Nithyananda took to 
        sitting in front of the <em>jiva samadhi </em>of 
        Arunagiri Yogiswara, at the Arunachaleshwara temple, and 
        that is where their meeting first happened.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="boxcontent">Arunagiri Yogiswara was the first 
        being who helped Nithyananda develop a conscious 
        experience of Himself. On one occasion, Arunagiri 
        Yogishwar mystically transported Nithyananda to a sacred 
        Banyan tree under which He taught His disciples as a 
        young Dakshinamurthi, and gave Nithyananda a saffron 
        robe, which is now at the ashram in Bangalore - living 
        proof that what happened then was not a dream!</p>
      <p align="justify" class="boxcontent">In their final encounter, Arunagiri 
        Yogiswara said to Nithyananda, ‘Dear one, you and I are 
        one. We can never get separated. But the play is over. 
        You will not miss me any longer. You will not be 
        separated. We are one.’ Saying this, the form of 
        Arunagiri Yogiswara merged into Nithyananda and 
        disappeared from his view. From that moment, Nithyananda 
        did not feel the separation from Arunagiri Yogiswara at 
        all. A deep fulfillment descended on him; a state of 
        bliss. Nithyananda says<strong>, </strong>‘it was 
        probably my first moment of realization of who I really 
        was. It was my first spiritual experience, my first 
        moment of enlightenment.’</p>
      <p align="justify">It was only later that Nithyananda realized that the 
        person he played with, he related so closely with, this 
        Arunagiri Yogiswara was none other than Arunachala, Siva 
        Himself.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="greylinktext"><em class="boxcontentbrown"><strong>Annamalai Swamigal</strong></em><br>
          <img height="203" hspace="5" src="../images/web.archive.org/web/20100708062846im_/http%EF%B9%95/srianandeshwaratemple.dhyanapeetam.org/images/Annamalai_Swamigal.jpg" width="140" align="left">Around the age of 10, Nithyananda 
        started going to the Ramana Ashram in Tiruvannamalai, 
        where one day He met Annamalai Swamigal, an enlightened 
        disciple of Ramana Maharishi. Annamalai Swamigal was a 
        master of the <em>advaita </em>philosophy of 
        non-duality. A lasting impression was created in the 
        mind of Young Nithyananda through Annamalai Swamigal’s 
        teachings, which remained a source of strength and 
        inspiration in years to come. Hs experience with 
        Annamalai Swamigal helped Nithyananda to go beyond the 
        illusion of thoughts directly into the source of 
        thoughts.</p>
      <div align="justify">Nithyananda 
        practiced the technique that Annamalai Swamigal had 
        taught him faithfully, and around age twelve, when he 
        was sitting on a rock on Arunachala hill in meditation, 
        the first experience of Cosmic Consciousness, or satori, 
        happened. In the midst of his meditation, Nithyananda 
        felt something opening up within him. It was like a 
        vessel inside getting broken and a door opening 
        simultaneously, an experience of creation and 
        destruction at the same time. It was an experience of 
        utter bliss, serene calmness and connectedness with the 
        Universe.&nbsp; Even with his eyes closed, Nithyananda 
        could see in a panoramic vision encompassing all 360 
        degrees around him.<span class="Subhead"><strong><br>
          Later Years</strong></span> </div>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">Nithyananda would 
        often meditate all night long in the cremation grounds 
        of Tiruvannamalai, absorbed in the vibrant silence of 
        Arunachala, and at the break of dawn, he would return 
        home. During his teenage years, after a profound 
        cognitive shift in his understanding through an 
        encounter with a Siddha in Thiruvannamalai, the urge 
        which he had since childhood, to leave home as a 
        sannyasi, reached its peak. After completing his diploma 
        in Mechanical Engineering at Gudiyattam, Nithyananda 
        made the final resolve to set out on his spiritual 
        journey as a wandering ascetic. He embarked on what was 
        to be an arduous journey, stretching thousands of miles 
        covered mostly by foot, over a period of 6 years, 
        traversing the land of Bharat. From Tapovan in the 
        Himalayas to Kanyakumari in the South, from Dwaraka in 
        the West to Ganga Sagar in the East, Nithyananda 
        wandered for several years in India and in Nepal, 
        practicing intense austerities and studying with many 
        sadhus. </p>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">Amongst Nithyananda’s 
        numerous soul-stirring experiences was this one, in the 
        Himalayas:<br>
        One day in Gaurikund, high in the 
        Himalayas, he saw a lovely vision, of a young man with a 
        glowing countenance and flowing locks, walking towards 
        him with long strides and captivating grace. He 
        realized, only after physically verifying the solidity 
        of the radiant and divine being facing him, it was <strong>Mahaavatar Babaji</strong>, the Enlightened 
        Master who has dwelled in the Himalayas for thousands of 
        years in perpetual youth. At the moment of passing by 
        him, Babaji looked into his eyes and pronounced, 
        '<em>Paramahamsa Sri Nithyananda</em>!’ – signifying the 
        state he would soon come to 
        achieve.<br>
    <br>
        Nithyananda's single-minded pursuit of 
        the Divine truth led to deeper and more profound 
        experiences over the years. Finally, when He was 22 
        years old and staying on the banks of the river Narmada, 
        the final explosion happened, into the experience of <strong>Superconsciousness, </strong><strong>where </strong>space and time, body and mind, the seer and the 
        seen - all dissolved into<strong> the state of Eternal 
          Bliss, </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> Nithya 
            Ananda. </strong></p>
      <p align="justify" class="Subhead"><strong>After Enlightenment</strong></p>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">After the explosion of 
        superconsciousness, Nithyananda stayed in Erode, on the 
        banks of the river Kaveri in Tamil Nadu for a few 
        months, healing people and teaching meditation. Guided 
        by Divine Vision, Nithyananda soon left Erode and came 
        to the outskirts of Bangalore, where He found the place 
        of His ashram, home to a 600-year old sacred and 
        mystical banyan tree as revealed in His Vision. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="Subhead"><strong>The Mission</strong></p>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">In the Master’s own 
        words, "Enlightenment flowers when individual 
        consciousness disappears into Universal Consciousness. 
        It is the no-mind experience, and out of it Ecstasy and 
        Energy are born. This Energy is what I harness, to help 
        humanity to blossom in all dimensions of life, and to 
        attain and radiate Eternal Bliss - Nithyananda". </p>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">Bliss is a state of 
        heightened awareness of the reasons for our fear, joy, 
        sorrow or love. It is a state of being in tune with the 
        Cosmos, the ideal state to be. 'Be Blissful!' are the 
        words the Master utters to constantly remind us of our 
        true nature. With a pragmatic yet compassionate approach 
        to life, and an enlightened insight into the core of 
        human nature, through lucid explanation of practical 
        issues and practical meditation techniques, He helps 
        individuals to blossom in every sphere of life, be it 
        physical, mental, emotional or 
        spiritual.<br>
    <br>
        Nithyananda's healing touch has given 
        relief to millions of people suffering from a spectrum 
        of illnesses, both physical and psychological. His 
        method of healing – <strong>Nithya Spiritual </strong><strong>Healing</strong>, has its roots in 
        meditation and harnesses the Divine Energy to allow it 
        to flow to the recipient of the healing. Nithyananda not 
        only heals, but also initiates those who desire to be an 
        instrument of the Divine energy, to become healers. 
        Today, thousands of Nithya Spiritual Healers and healing 
        centers carry out this service to humanity at large and 
        touch tens of thousands of people each day. </p>
      <p class="boxcontent" align="justify">Nithyananda has 
        developed a diverse range of meditation programs devised 
        for the modern minds of our generation. The remarkable 
        techniques and processes that comprise the meditation 
        programs help the flowering and explosion of individual 
        consciousness, and are offered by ordained teachers, or 
        acharyas, trained personally by Him. Advanced level 
        programs are conducted by Nithyananda Himself, and are a 
        rare and unprecedented opportunity to be in the presence 
        of the Master, and to experience the deep stillness, 
        silence and ecstasy of our inner being.</p>
