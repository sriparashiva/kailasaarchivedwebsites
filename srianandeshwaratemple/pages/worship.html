          This whole universe, and the universal energy are 
          symbolically constituted of five elements, namely ether, air, water, 
          fire and earth. Even our mind and body are made up of 
          matter. That is the reason you can see that  food can easily 
          affect the way in which you think. We can see that when we have 
          alcohol, our way of thinking is completely distorted. This proves 
          that mind is matter, as only matter can affect matter. If our mind is 
          affected by liquor, it shows clearly that it is made of matter. Mind is 
          matter, and it is not spirit as we think.</span><br/>

      Falling in tune with 
      these five elements can change whatever can be changed. It can 
      change our body and mind, and whatever you know as you. Whatever  
      can be changed is matter, and whatever  can&rsquo;t - is consciousness. 
      Consciousness can&rsquo;t be changed. All that we can do is change what 
      can be changed, which is matter. All spiritual practice is to 
      transform matter!<br/>

      the Cosmic energy through water, by taking a bath in a river or water 
      pond, it is called Thirtha Snana (holy bath). When we relate with 
      Cosmic energy through fire, it is called Homa. When Cosmic energy is 
      related through the air element, by repeating some mantra, it is called 
      Mantra Japa. When we fall in-tune with the Cosmic energy through 
      ether, it is called Meditation.<br/>

      Upanishad:<br/>
&nbsp;- from &lsquo;akasha&rsquo; or ether came air or 
      &lsquo;vayu&rsquo;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;- from &lsquo;vayu&rsquo; came fire or 
      &lsquo;agni&rsquo;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;- from &lsquo;agni&rsquo; came water&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;- from 
      water came the earth and finally everything else.&nbsp;<br/>
      <br/>
      In 
      this manner, the energy is harnessed. It is understood that this 
      Cosmic energy exists beyond ether, beyond space, as Atman or Atma 
      Shakti or&nbsp; pure consciousness!<br/>
&nbsp;- Through visualization 
      or meditation, this energy is brought to &lsquo;akasha shakti&rsquo; - ether or 
      space.&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; From ether through verbalization or 
      mantras it is brought to the air.&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Through fire 
      rituals such as &lsquo;homas&rsquo; it is brought to the 
      fire.&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; From the fire it is brought to the &lsquo;kumbha&rsquo; or 
      water.&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; And finally, this energy is installed in 
      the &lsquo;Bimba&rsquo; or the idol or moorthi or vigraha.<br/>
      <br/>
      When the 
      &lsquo;prana pratishta&rsquo; or energy is installed in the idol, it is no 
      longer an idol; it becomes a Deity or &lsquo;Archavatara&rsquo; with different 
      incarnations of God. The Upanishads beautifully explain how the 
      &lsquo;Brahmanda&rsquo; expresses itself in the form of &lsquo;pindanda&rsquo; through the 
      idols. This Cosmic energy radiates itself, making it available to us 
      through these idols, statues or vigrahas. One can derive enormous 
      benefits by understanding this science.&nbsp;<br/>

              Consciousness!<br/>
              </b><br/>
              Worship is based on the truth, that 
       the whole of the Universe is constituted of thoughts and energy vibrations. 
       It is alive and bubbling with&nbsp; our thoughts and emotions. 
          Modern scientists have agreed, starting from Einstein, who 
          says that there is no such thing as matter and energy, with separate  
          boundaries between the two, but that the whole Universe is energy. 
          The last statement of science and quantum physics saying that 
          everything is energy, is the first statement of the first Veda of the 
          first Upanishad. &quot;Isha vashyam idam sarvam&quot;... meaning, whatever exists... 
          is energy... </div>

        <th scope="col"><div align="justify"><span class="style22">There have been numerous groundbreaking explorations of the 
          science of thought, and its benefits on an individual and the world 
          around him. Several experiments demonstrate that a thought  affects things around an individual. Both inner and outer world 
          scientists of many cultures, have time and again proven, and are still 
          proving that thought, when intensely harnessed in the inner world, 
          produces tremendous noticeable differences in the outer world. The 
          intensity also manifests itself when performed as a group, as seen in this picture. Thought 
          generates intelligence, which can improve our lives, and impact others 
          around us,  to powerfully change our world. </span></div></th>

        <th height="314" colspan="3" scope="col"><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt" align="justify">When it comes to matter, when you divide, 
          matter reduces in quantity. For example, an apple, if it has to be 
          shared by four people has to be cut into four pieces.
            <o:p></o:p>
          But, when it comes to energy, anything 
          shared only multiplies. If we have 10 volts of 
          electricity in a wire, one person touching the wire will feel 10 
          volts, and four people touching the same wire will also feel 10 
          volts.
          <o:p></o:p>
          Therefore, the powerful energy of 
          Pujas and Homas, when done by a group of people, gets shared in total 
          by the entire group. Imagine 10 &lsquo;volts&rsquo; of energy generated by each 
          person, and 100 people all sitting together in a group worship. 
          10x100 =1000 volts!
          <o:p></o:p>
        </p>
          <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 14.4pt" align="justify"> Worship is the most effective when 
            performed as a group. With the collective consciousness expressing in 
            the intense vibration of the energy field of the worship space, 
            miracles  happen! Peace, harmony and celebration  naturally 
            manifest, and become abundant in the society around us, preventing  crime and natural calamities. Worship is the 
            best way to keep  society in absolute balance peace, and harmony!
